# Generate Text - Experimenting with different styles

> A random text generation GUI

Final project for LIN 353C (Intro to Computational Linguistics)

# Background
This application can generate random text in the style of 5 different authors using some of their works from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org): 
* Jane Austen
* G.K. Chesterton
* William Shakespeare
* Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
* Fyodor Dostoyevsky

It generates text using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and bigrams (trigrams later if time permits)

The GUI was made using PyQT5 in Python3

## Libraries used: 
* NLTK
* PyQT5
